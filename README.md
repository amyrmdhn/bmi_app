# BMI App

BMI App is a BMI calculator app that I created as an excercise in cross-platform application development using the Dart programming language and the Flutter framework.

During the development of this application, I applied various Flutter concepts that I have learned. These concepts include implementing state management using Provider, combining widgets to create slightly more complex UIs, designing responsive widget sizes with MediaQuery, and most importantly, implementing the MVVM architecture. The MVVM architecture aims to separate business logic from the UI, enhancing the overall structure and maintainability of the application.


Furthermore, I adopted Vincent Driessen's widely recognized git branching approach in the development of the application. Although I only implemented a portion of his comprehensive strategy, the application remains straightforward and employs dummy data from user input.

I established two branches: the main branch, serving as the stable application branch, and the development branch, where active development takes place.

Upon completing development on the development branch and ensuring the application's stability, I merge it into the main branch using the command **git merge --no-ff develop**. This ensures a smooth merge process and maintains a clear branching history with a merge commit.
